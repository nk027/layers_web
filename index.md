# About

In the project *Layers of Natural Resource Extraction*, we develop and apply new methods to assess the impacts of resource extraction. New Bayesian methods allow us to better capture and analyze the economic, environmental and social layers of these impacts, and help us better understand the interconnections between them and across time and space.
